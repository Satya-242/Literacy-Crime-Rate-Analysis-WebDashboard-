    <h1>What is Corruption?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Corruption</strong> refers to the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It can take many forms and often occurs in both public and private sectors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bribery</strong> – offering or receiving something of value to influence actions</li>
      <li><strong>Embezzlement</strong> – stealing or misappropriating funds placed in one’s trust</li>
      <li><strong>Favoritism & Nepotism</strong> – unfair advantages given to friends or relatives</li>
      <li><strong>Extortion</strong> – obtaining something through force or threats</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How is Corruption Measured?</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike crimes like theft or homicide, corruption is often hidden and difficult to detect directly. So, it's typically measured using **perception-based indices**:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)</strong> – Published by Transparency International</li>
      <li><strong>World Bank’s Control of Corruption Indicator</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Global Corruption Barometer</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)</h2>
    <p>
      The CPI ranks countries on a scale from 0 to 100:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0</strong> = Highly corrupt</li>
      <li><strong>100</strong> = Very clean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is based on expert assessments and opinion surveys.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is it Hard to Measure?</h2>
    <p>
      Corruption often goes unreported due to fear, political influence, or lack of evidence. Therefore, perception and indirect metrics are widely used.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Data Sources:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transparency International</li>
      <li>World Bank Governance Indicators</li>
      <li>OECD Anti-Corruption Reports</li>
    </ul>
